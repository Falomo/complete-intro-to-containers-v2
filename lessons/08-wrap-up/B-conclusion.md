That's it Congratulations on completing the Complete Intro to Containers, version 2. On one hand, I feel like this course is pretty dense and a lot of systems-level stuff is thrown at you in a short amount of time. On the other hand, I feel like all of this stuff is actually more approachable than it seems at first impression. I started doing this stuff when I worked at Microsoft because I wanted to be able to sound intelligent when I spoke to the smart people making Azure work and it turns out I really like it. Every since I've always been in and around cloud stuff and it really started with my love for mucking around with containers.

Let's review what we talked about:

- What containers are
- chroot and code jails
- Linux namespaces and how to limit processes on the same OS
- cgroups and how to limit resources to processes
- What an image is
- How to build a JavaScript project in Docker
- Docker Desktop and dev tools to use with Docker
- Building Docker images
- Dockerfiles in depth
- How to build containers both for production performance and so they rebuild quickly
- How to make smaller containers
- Alpine and alternative Linux distros
- How to do multi stage builds
- Distroless and other alternatives to Alpine
- A project on building your own static asset server
- Bind mounts and volumes
- Dev containers
- Networking in Docker
- Docker Compose and multi container setups
- Kubernetes and Kompose
- What other tools are out there

That's a lot of stuff! Congrats, you are now _ahead_ of the curve on containers and this will serve you whole career. Containers aren't going anywhere; they're just becoming a bigger part of our workflows. Every day you interact with dozens if not hundreds of containers in some way. I see that only increasing as everything becomes a deploy target, from fridges to watches to billboards.

Thanks, and as always, please let me know how you liked the course!
